CLone the application on github
Check node version by running node -v (Should be 5.10.1)
Then run "nvm list" system default should be "5.10.1" 
If there is no node.js or nvm installed, follow the instrunctions on this link 
"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04"
Verify the following; config file- copy couchdb.json.example to couchdb.json
                                 - database.json.example to database.json
                                 - dde.json
                                 - site.json.example to site.json
copy the .examples in public/config to .json
Then run ./setup.sh
DDE application username should be "admin"
DDE application password should be "test"
Threshold should be less than the batch size e.g if you set threshold to 10 then batch size can be 100 or more
Sync targets should be zero "0" if you are setting on a local machine
Then you can run the application while dde2 is already running on another server 

NOTE: If the application server is not running, check the public/config .jsonfiles and make sure the basePath and ddePaths are the same as your machine's ip address
